### XSH-1 · P2 · Complete private and resource baseline acceptance

- **Area:** Performance
- **Where:** `dev/util-linux/resources.py:1632`, `dev/util-linux/acceptance.py:926`
- **Problem:** Final private/resource qualification remains unrun on the current frozen source. The scheduler comparison failed, so composed baseline close cannot proceed.
- **Recommendation:** After scheduler qualification, run the private and resource gates on the same source. Complete baseline close with its one-use independent review and readiness checks.
- **Fix with:** benchmark-checklist
- **Effort:** S

### XSH-3 · P3 · Finish the deferred consolidation acceptance matrix

- **Area:** Tests
- **Where:** `docs/CAMPAIGN-PERFORMANCE-DEPLOYMENT.md`, `dev/performance/check.py`
- **Problem:** Canonical, supplemental, profile, observer, forced and comparative checks passed on R13. Scheduler pairs failed. Focused repairs need qualification, and UDP failures and full-corpus timeouts remain unexplained. Private/resource close remains unrun.
- **Recommendation:** Complete G1's remaining queue on one qualified source, then publish the accepted baseline and retire obsolete infrastructure under XSH-19.
- **Unmet:** Full combined qualification remains manual-only on a stable source. The known XSH-29 deadline causes have focused written/desugared proof; that does not supply full-corpus acceptance. The replacement image and repaired launcher are available, and historical passes do not qualify them.
- **Fix with:** orchestrate
- **Effort:** M

### XSH-14 · P3 · Reuse import-graph checks across lint candidates

- **Area:** Performance
- **Where:** `crates/xsht/src/lint.rs`, `crates/xsht/src/cli`
- **Problem:** Each lint candidate probe parses, loads, and checks the unchanged import graph again. Large fix runs repeat the same work for every candidate.
- **Recommendation:** Measure shared checking, grouped candidates, and clean-corpus probe skipping. Keep the smallest design that preserves diagnostics and fix safety.
- **Unmet:** Build a matched release pair after feature integration, then collect guarded timing on a quiet host. Candidate `cb8c23d6d` remains outside integration on `backlog-lane-diagnostics`. Existing products use optimized verification, so their memory and diagnostic controls are useful but cannot qualify production performance; no valid timing samples exist.
- **Fix with:** make-it-fast
- **Effort:** M

### XSH-19 · P3 · Retire consolidation-only gate infrastructure after acceptance

- **Area:** Build
- **Where:** `dev/consolidation/winddown/gate-tools/`, `dev/performance/check.py`, `dev/util-linux/acceptance.py`, `docs/CAMPAIGN-PERFORMANCE-DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Problem:** Baseline qualification currently depends on campaign-specific controllers, receipt adapters and historical pins. Leaving those dependencies in the everyday gate path makes subsequent changes require campaign history. The accepted baseline is still pending, so deletion must follow G1.
- **Recommendation:** Execute G5 immediately after G1. Trace current callers, move reusable checks behind ordinary developer commands, and delete obsolete adapters, duplicate entry points and historical-pin dependencies. Preserve required gates and their rejection controls. Update testing and baseline docs. Keep historical evidence outside the everyday command path.
- **Fix with:** dead-code-archaeology
- **Effort:** M

### XSH-23 · P4 · Evaluate bbtree as the ordered-map implementation

- **Deferred:** The owner is not interested in this evaluation at present. Exclude it from the active backlog run until the owner reopens it, even after a baseline becomes available.
- **Area:** Performance
- **Where:** `src/runtime/value.rs:172`, `src/runtime/value.rs:958`, `src/sema/schemes.rs`, `src/sema/constraints.rs`
- **Problem:** `laputa-systems/bbtree` claims about 5x faster single-thread lookups than std `BTreeMap` with `unsync::BBTreeMap` as a drop-in. XSH uses `BTreeMap` throughout the checker, verifier and runtime values, but most maps are probably tiny, where the gain may vanish. The measured campaign growth is generalization-map copying, which depends on clone cost. `unproven` that ordered-map operations matter at all.
- **Recommendation:** After the post-inference performance baseline, profile the 512-unit generalization witness and script startup to rank `BTreeMap` time. Only if it is a meaningful share, swap `unsync::BBTreeMap` in behind one alias at the hottest owner and compare interleaved CPU time. Vet the single maintainer, its `unsafe` and allocation code, `InlinkeKey` on our key types, and the build-time, binary-size and startup gates before widening.
